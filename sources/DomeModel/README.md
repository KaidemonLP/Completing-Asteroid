# Dome Model

This is the dome protecting players from the vacuum of space. According to concept art, it should be within the outer pits and intersect the buildings, but we thought it's too much of a bother.

So we're putting it in the skybox.

## Source files

* The .blend file contains the models at 1/16 scale
* .smd files are the exported geometry
* .qc files are used to compile the final .mdl files from the .smd's

## To do

- [x] Model the dome
- [x] Scale to map
- [ ] Finalize material (might require redoing UVs)
- [ ] Put it in the map!
