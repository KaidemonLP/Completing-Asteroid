# Completing Asteroid

## Folder navigation

* **full compile** - ??
* **quick compile** - The vmf was last found here (May 2019)
* **screenshots** - WIP images
* **tf** - Contains everything that should go into the packed end product
* **sources** - Various stuff needed to make the shipped stuff

## To do

- [ ] Fix the areaportals
- [ ] Finish the dome
- [ ] Finish RED side
- [ ] "INCOMING SHIP" plate with an on/off style
- [ ] Detailing

## Good ideas

* Edit the map one-at-a-time
  * Let us know if you're working on it
  * Give us a deadline
* Try using this git thing?
* We're working on RED first, then mirroring it to BLU(?)
* Put the dome in the skybox
  * Use an env_cubemap!
